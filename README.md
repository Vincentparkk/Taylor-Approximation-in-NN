# Taylor-Approximation-in-NN

Experimental Setup
Dataset: MNIST / Fashion-MNIST
Model: LeNet-5 / Custom CNN
Baseline: Full model accuracy
Metric: 
Accuracy
model size(parameters), 
FLOPs (Floating Point Operations: the computational cost of running the model)

1. LeNet-5 + Taylor Pruning (MNIST)
Full model vs 50% Pruned vs 70% Pruned
2. Custom CNN + Taylor Pruning (Fashion-MNIST)
Full model vs 50% Pruned vs 70% Pruned
